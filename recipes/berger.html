    <p><h1>Burgur recipe |Veggie burger</h1>
    </p>
    <p>this Burger Recipe covers everything needed to make delightful veggie burgers from scratch, including how to prepare and pan fry delicious homemade vegetable patties. And because no veggie burger is complete without its own special sauce, I have included instruction on how to make the perfect tangy, sweet and spicy mayonnaise dressing.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>Mixed Vegetables: Steamed potatoes, carrots, French beans and green peas make up the bulk of the patty. Garlic, ginger and green chilies (hot peppers) are sautéed and then added to the patty mix for an amazing flavor.</li>
    <li>Spices: I use Indian spices in this burger recipe to flavor the patties, including coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, red chili powder or cayenne pepper and turmeric powder. These spices combine for a very flavorful patty. You can play around with the combination of these spices and also add your choice of herbs and spices. </li>
<li>Burger Buns: I used fresh whole wheat burger buns that I got from a local bakery. You can also make homemade burger buns, if you prefer. Since it takes time to make the veggie burger patty itself, I recommend making the buns in advance.</li>
<li>Spiced Mayonnaise Dressing: I used an eggless mayonnaise as the base for the dressing in this burger recipe. For a vegan burger use vegan mayonnaise. Spices, lemon juice, vinegar, oil and a bit of sugar is added to the mayonnaise for a custom dressing that complements the veggie burger perfectly.

<h2>How to make Veggie Burger from scratch</h2>
<ol><li>1. Preparing breadcrumbs
    If you have breadcrumbs then simply skip these steps and move on to the steps of preparing veggies below. For a more crispy texture, I recommend using panko bread crumbs.
    
    1. Break 6 to 7 slices of bread and add in a mixer or dry grinder. You can use a few days old bread like white, brown, multi grain or whole wheat bread.</li>
<li>. Grind to a semi-fine consistency and do not make it floury or powdery. Place the bread crumbs in a plate or bowl. Set aside.

    Breadcrumbs are used to bind the vegetable patties. Breading them with breadcrumbs also makes them crisp.</li>
<li>2. Preparing veggies
    3. Now rinse and steam 3 medium to large potatoes, 1 medium to large carrot, 8 to 9 french beans and ⅓ to ½ cup green peas until they are completely cooked. You can cook or steam the vegetables in a stove-top pressure cooker, pan or instant pot. I have listed the cooking methods below.
    
    Stove-top pressure cooker: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots and beans. Place them with the green peas in a pan or bowl. Add 2 cups water in a 3 litre cooker. Place a small trivet inside. Place the bowl with the veggies on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes on medium-heat. Let the pressure fall naturally in the cooker and then only remove the lid.
    
    Instant pot method: Pour 1.5 cups water in the steel insert of 6 quart IP. Keep a trivet inside the steel insert. Place the whole potatoes, carrots, beans in a steamer pan or on the trivet. Take green peas in a small bowl and place it on the steamer pan or on the trivet. Pressure cook for 10 to 12 minutes until veggies are tender. Let the pressure release naturally.
    Cooking in a pan: Peel and chop potatoes, carrots in small cubes. Chop the beans to small pieces. Place the chopped veggies and green peas in a pan. Add water just about covering the vegetables. Cover and simmer on medium-low flame until veggies are fork tender.
    Once cooked strain the vegetables well. There should be no water or moisture in them.</li></ol>
